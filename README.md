# C# Coding Standars and Naming Conventions
### Terminology and Definitions for Naming Conventions:

**Camel Case** (camelCase): The first letter of the word is lower case and then each first letter of the part of the word is upper case;

**Pascal Case** (PascalCase): The first letter of the word is upper case and then each first letter of the part of the word is upper case;

**Underscore Prefix** (_underscore): The word begins with underscore char and for the rest of the word use camelCase rule;

## General Rules
1. Use Pascal Case for Class names:

Example:

`csharp
public class HelloWorld { ... };
`

2. Use Pascal Case for Method names:

Example:

public void SayHello(string name) { ... };
